# bootstrappainting
In this project I practice using the fundamentals of Bootstrap grid by piecing together a famous painting, namely Piet Mondrianâ€™s Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow.

render the painting differently based on screen size (use breakpoints).
add different background colors using Bootstrap and
add some interactivity using Bootstrap.(JS)
